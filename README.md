# work_louder redesign

I worked on redesigning the Work Louder website, and so far I have a functioning landing page.

On the product roadmap I have some of the bigger product pages, and user flows to show how a user would purchase at least one product.

Keep in mind that I will never be making this a full-fledged e-commerce store. It's purely for demonstrational purposes.
